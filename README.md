# Two Sum

## Problem Description

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

## Solution Signatures
```python
def calc_target_sum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> Union[List[int], bool]:
    pass
    
def calc_target_sum_2(nums: List[int], target: int) -> Union[List[int], bool]:
    pass
